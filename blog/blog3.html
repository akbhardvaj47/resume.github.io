                <div class="key-trends">
                    <h2>Key Web Development Trends to Watch</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>JavaScript Frameworks:</strong> JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular continue to rise in popularity. With improvements in performance and user experience, these frameworks are at the core of modern web development.</li>
                        <li><strong>Serverless Architecture:</strong> Serverless computing allows developers to build and run applications without managing servers. This trend is growing due to its ability to simplify infrastructure and reduce costs.</li>
                        <li><strong>AI and Machine Learning Integration:</strong> Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are transforming web development by automating tasks, enhancing user experiences, and providing smarter insights.</li>
                        <li><strong>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs):</strong> PWAs combine the best of web and mobile apps, offering offline capabilities, faster load times, and enhanced performance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Motion UI Design:</strong> Motion UI, the use of animations and transitions to enhance the user experience, is gaining traction in 2025 for its ability to engage users in dynamic ways.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="trends-in-detail">
                    <h2>In-Depth Look at These Trends</h2>
                    <p>Let’s explore these trends in detail and understand how they are impacting web development:</p>
                    
                    <h3>JavaScript Frameworks</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js have become indispensable in creating dynamic web applications. These frameworks offer scalability, better performance, and efficient development processes, making them a must-know for developers in 2025.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Serverless Architecture</h3>
                    <p>Serverless computing is a revolutionary approach that abstracts away the infrastructure. Developers focus on writing functions without worrying about server maintenance. This allows for cost efficiency and scalability, as it only charges based on the actual usage.</p>
                    
                    <h3>AI and Machine Learning</h3>
                    <p>AI-driven features such as chatbots, personalization algorithms, and voice recognition are becoming standard in web applications. These technologies are being integrated to automate repetitive tasks and provide users with more personalized experiences.</p>

                    <h3>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)</h3>
                    <p>PWAs bring mobile-like features to the web, including offline access and push notifications. They can be installed on users’ devices, offering the best of both worlds, which significantly improves user retention and engagement.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Motion UI Design</h3>
                    <p>Motion UI is not just about visual appeal. It enhances interaction by guiding users through transitions and providing feedback. Smooth animations can improve navigation and make websites feel more interactive and responsive.</p>
